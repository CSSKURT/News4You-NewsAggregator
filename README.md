## üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionality
- Uses NewsAPI to fetch news articles.
- Allows users to search for specific topics.
- Supports article sorting (newest first or alphabetically).
- User authentication system with login/registration.
- Ability to save favorite articles.
- User profiles and dashboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Components
- PHP-based backend.
- Bootstrap for frontend styling.
- MySQL database for user management.
- Session-based authentication.
- Responsive design.

## üõ†Ô∏è REST API
The project includes a REST API that allows for programmatic access to various functionalities, enabling a personalized news experience for users. The API facilitates user interactions with the news aggregator by allowing them to set preferences, retrieve tailored content, and manage their accounts. Key endpoints include:


### 1. User Authentication and Management
- **User Registration and Login:**
  - **File:** `api.php`
  - **Functionality:** This file handles user registration and login requests. It allows users to create accounts and authenticate themselves using their email and password. Upon successful login, a session is initiated, enabling users to access personalized features.

### 2. Article Management
- **Save Article:**
  - **File:** `save_article.php`
  - **Functionality:** This script allows logged-in users to save articles they find interesting. When a user submits an article to be saved, the script retrieves the user's ID from the session and inserts the article details (title, URL, published date, and description) into the `saved_articles` table in the database. After saving, the user is redirected back to their profile page with a success message.

- **Unsave Article:**
  - **File:** `unsave_article.php`
  - **Functionality:** This script enables users to remove articles from their saved list. It checks if the user is logged in and retrieves their ID. If an article ID is provided, the script deletes the corresponding entry from the `saved_articles` table, allowing users to manage their saved content effectively. A success or error message is displayed based on the outcome.

### 3. News Retrieval
- **Fetch News Articles:**
  - **File:** `news_app.php`
  - **Functionality:** This file is responsible for fetching news articles from the News API based on user-defined topics. Users can input a topic and choose a sorting preference (newest first or alphabetically). The script constructs a request to the News API, retrieves the articles, and displays them on the page. Users can also save articles directly from this interface.
